## üëã About

Hello! My name is Luthfi, and I am an undergraduate Computer Science student at the [University of Indonesia (UI)](https://cs.ui.ac.id/en/). Currently, I am fortunate to collaborate with [Prof. Raul Castro Fernandez](https://raulcastrofernandez.com/) from [UChicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) to scale data discovery through ML/NLP techniques. At the same time, I am going to be a Teaching Assistant for Information Retrieval in Fall 2024.

My research is in the intersection of **Database Systems** and **Machine Learning**, specifically in designing LLM-based dataset discovery system. However, I am also open to other systems-related areas, as I have strong backgrounds in **Operating Systems** and **Distributed Systems**.
